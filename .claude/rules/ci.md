# CI rules

Source of truth: `silexdata.collection_skeleton`. Change it there, not here.

## How CI is wired

`.github/workflows/` in this repo contains **thin callers only**. Each one
delegates to a reusable workflow hosted on the orphan `ci` branch of
[silexdata.collection_skeleton](https://github.com/SilexDataTeam/silexdata.collection_skeleton/tree/ci):

```yaml
jobs:
  lint:
    uses: SilexDataTeam/silexdata.collection_skeleton/.github/workflows/reusable-lint.yml@v1
```

| Caller | Delegates to | Does |
|---|---|---|
| `lint.yml` | `reusable-lint.yml` | pre-commit over all files |
| `nox.yml` | `reusable-nox.yml` | every default antsibull-nox session (licensing, docs, build/import, lint) plus ansible-test sanity and units across the ansible-core matrix |
| `coverage.yml` | `reusable-coverage.yml` | ansible-test units + integration across the ansible-core matrix, aggregated |
| `docs.yml` | `reusable-docs.yml` | antsibull-docs site + coverage report → GitHub Pages |
| `changelog.yml` | `reusable-changelog.yml` | requires a changelog fragment on every PR |
| `release.yml` | `reusable-release.yml` | version bump, changelog, tag, publish to Galaxy |
| `sync-rules.yml` | `reusable-sync-rules.yml` | weekly: keeps the skeleton-managed files identical to the skeleton's and proposes any drift as a PR |

**To change CI behaviour, edit the `ci` branch of the skeleton repo and move
the tag.** Do not fork logic into this repo — it will drift silently.
Dependabot bumps the `@v1` pins here when a new major ships.

The Nox workflow uses antsibull-nox's two reusable workflows, as
community.sops does. "Run extra sanity tests" runs every *default* session:
`lint`, `docs-check`, `license-check`, `extra-checks`, `build-import-check`,
`ansible-lint`. The matrix jobs run the ansible-test sessions. Keep the
ansible-test sessions at `default = false` in `antsibull-nox.toml` - the
matrix runs them anyway, and marking them default would make the extra job
repeat the whole matrix, so the Nox workflow fails if any of them - or
`ee_check` - is set `default = true`. To enforce something new, make it a default nox
session.

ansible-test reads only `tests/sanity/ignore-<version>.txt` for the version it
runs, so when antsibull-nox adds a new ansible-core to the matrix, a collection
with sanity ignores needs a copy for it (with its `.license` sidecar). The Nox
workflow fails, naming the file to copy, when the newest version in the matrix
has no ignore file but the version before it has one. Copy it only if its
entries still apply; delete any the new version no longer needs.

## Required checks

Branch protection requires these five, and nothing else:

- `lint / pre-commit (lint)`
- `nox / Nox result`
- `coverage / Coverage result`
- `docs / Build collection documentation`
- `changelog / Require a changelog fragment`

`Nox result` and `Coverage result` are dedicated gate jobs. They exist because
GitHub reports a **skipped** job as *passing* a required check, and because the
matrix legs have names that change with the ansible-core matrix. Each gate runs
`if: always()` and fails explicitly unless everything it depends on succeeded.
Never require a matrix leg, or any job that is skipped on failure.

## What is detected, not configured

Do not hardcode these in a caller; they are read at run time:

- **namespace / name** — from `galaxy.yml`.
- **minimum ansible-core** — from `meta/runtime.yml`'s `requires_ansible`, for
  both the Nox matrix and the Coverage matrix. To change the floor, edit that
  file.
- **release tarball name** — derived from `galaxy.yml`.

## Skeleton-managed files are synced, not edited here

The files the skeleton repo's `sync-manifest.txt` lists are exact copies of
its `skeleton/`: `.claude/` (everything but `CLAUDE.md`), and the shared
tooling configuration - `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, `.yamllint`,
`.ansible-lint`, `.pymarkdown.json`, `.markdownlint.json`, `noxfile.py`,
`pyproject.toml` and `.github/dependabot.yml`. `sync-rules.yml` (**Sync from
the skeleton**) runs weekly, and on demand from the Actions tab: it copies
them, mirroring `.claude/` and deleting what the skeleton no longer has, and
commits the result with a `trivial` changelog fragment to the `sync/skeleton`
branch.

- It opens a PR from that branch. Whenever the sync pushes to it, the PR's CI
  runs wait for a maintainer to select **Approve workflows to run** in the
  merge box - GitHub's rule for pushes made with `GITHUB_TOKEN`.
- Where the organization forbids GitHub Actions from creating PRs, the run
  instead warns with a link that opens the PR in one click. A PR a human opens
  runs CI straight away.

So change any of these in the skeleton repo; an edit made here is reverted by
the next sync. If code trips a lint or ruff rule, fix the code rather than
loosening the shared configuration. `CLAUDE.md` is this collection's own - put
collection-specific guidance there - as are `antsibull-nox.toml`,
`tests/config.yml`, `galaxy.yml`, the README and the docs.

## Secrets

Only the release path needs secrets. Everything else runs on the automatic
`GITHUB_TOKEN`. Both are optional: until both are configured, the release
workflow skips with a notice rather than failing. Set them with
`/setup-collection-repo`, which never exposes the values.

| Secret | Needed by | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `RELEASE_TOKEN` | `release.yml` | pushes the release commit/tag past branch protection |
| `GALAXY_API_KEY` | `release.yml` | publishes to Ansible Galaxy |

## A constraint worth knowing

`GITHUB_TOKEN` is **categorically forbidden** from creating, updating or
deleting anything under `.github/workflows/`, and no `permissions:` key can
grant it — there is no `workflows:` key. Any automation that needs to rewrite
workflow files requires a PAT with `workflow` scope, or must be run locally
over SSH (SSH pushes are not subject to the restriction).

## Changelog fragments

Every PR needs one under `changelogs/fragments/`. CI checks for an added *or
modified* fragment, so extending an existing one counts.

```yaml
# changelogs/fragments/my-change.yml
minor_changes:
  - my_module - add support for X (https://github.com/.../pull/42).
```

Sections that do not trigger a release on their own: `trivial`,
`release_summary`. Below 1.0.0 nothing is released at all until a
`major_changes` fragment cuts 1.0.0 - see `workflow.md`.

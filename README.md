Enhancement to Cisco Meraki collections including a dynamic inventory plugin

This repository contains the `silexdata.meraki` Ansible Collection. The collection provides modules and plugins for managing Cisco Meraki networks, devices, and related resources with Ansible.

## Code of Conduct

We follow [Ansible Code of Conduct](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/community/code_of_conduct.html) in all our interactions within this project.

If you encounter abusive behavior violating the [Ansible Code of Conduct](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/community/code_of_conduct.html), please refer to the [policy violations](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/community/code_of_conduct.html#policy-violations) section of the Code of Conduct for information on how to raise a complaint.

## External requirements

Some modules and plugins require external libraries. Please check the requirements for each plugin or module you use in the documentation to find out which requirements are needed.

## Included content

Please check the included content on the [Ansible Galaxy page for this collection](https://galaxy.ansible.com/ui/repo/published/silexdata/meraki/).

## Documentation

The full collection documentation (module/plugin reference, generated with `antsibull-docs`) is published on
[GitHub Pages](https://silexdatateam.github.io/silexdata.meraki/).

The [interactive, line-by-line test coverage report](https://silexdatateam.github.io/silexdata.meraki/coverage/) is
published alongside it, reflecting the latest merge to `main`.

## Using this collection

You must install this collection from [Ansible Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/ui/repo/published/silexdata/meraki/) using the `ansible-galaxy` command-line tool, regardless of your Ansible installation type:

```shell
ansible-galaxy collection install silexdata.meraki
```

You can also include it in a `requirements.yml` file and install it via `ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml` using the format:

```yaml
collections:
- name: silexdata.meraki
```

Note that if you install the collection manually, it will not be upgraded automatically. To upgrade the collection to the latest available version, run the following command:

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install silexdata.meraki --upgrade
```

You can also install a specific version of the collection, for example, if you need to downgrade when something is broken in the latest version (please report an issue in this repository). Use the following syntax where `X.Y.Z` can be any [available version](https://galaxy.ansible.com/ui/repo/published/silexdata/meraki/):

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install silexdata.meraki:==X.Y.Z
```

See [Ansible Using collections](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/collections_using.html) for more details.

## Contributing to this collection

All types of contributions are very welcome.

Every change goes through a pull request: branch from an up-to-date `main`,
commit with [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)
messages, add or extend a changelog fragment under `changelogs/fragments/`,
and open a PR. It merges once every required check has passed; nobody pushes
to `main` directly. Merging publishes a new version when the PR's changelog
fragments call for one; `trivial` fragments release nothing. The full procedure
is in `.claude/rules/workflow.md`.

You can find more information in the [developer guide for collections](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/dev_guide/developing_collections.html#contributing-to-collections), and in the [Ansible Community Guide](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/community/index.html).

## Licensing

This collection is licensed under the **Apache License, Version 2.0** by

own SPDX header. The full license texts are under [LICENSES/](LICENSES).

| Path | License |

| plugin code in `plugins/` (the `cisco_meraki` inventory plugin) | `GPL-3.0-or-later` |
| everything else | `Apache-2.0` |

Plugin code is GPL-3.0-or-later because Ansible requires it for plugins that
run inside the controller.

header, read `.claude/rules/licensing.md` - in particular, code adapted from
another project keeps its original license and attribution.

Run `nox -e license-check` to verify compliance.
